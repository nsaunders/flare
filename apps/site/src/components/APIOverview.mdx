# API

Flare is offered in two packages. Both provide the same support for building
[applicative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicative_functor)-style user
interfaces as shown on the [Examples](/examples) page; however, they differ in
how these UIs are rendered. [flare](/api-docs/flare) offers a more
narrowly-focused API surface, while [flare-core](/api-docs/flare-core) provides
greater flexibility.

## flare

This package re-exports a subset of flare-core and is the best choice for use
cases with minimal customization requirements. The
[`runFlare`](/api-docs/flare#runflare) or
[`runFlareWith`](/api-docs/flare#runflarewith) procedures can be used to render
the UI. CSS is the recommended approach to customizing the appearance of various
UI elements.

## flare-core

The flare-core package provides applicative UI building blocks along with
additional APIs that allow the rendered markup to be customized. The
[`RunFlare`](/api-docs/flare-core#runflare)
[React](https://reactjs.org/) component can be used to render the UI, with its
`components` prop allowing various elements to be overridden using custom React
components.
