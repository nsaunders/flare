# Embedding in React

The [`RunFlare`](https://flare.js.org/api-docs/flare-core#runflare) component
provides the means to embed a Flare UI in a [React](https://reactjs.org)
application. This short guide explains how the `RunFlare` component works.

## Overview

The `RunFlare` component renders a Flare UI wherever it exists in the component
tree and invokes a callback each time the value changes in response to user
input.

The UI and callback are passed via `flare` and `handler` props, respectively.

## Generic Implementation

`RunFlare` is a generic component, which allows it to work with any Flare UI
regardless of the value produced. The only constraint is that the UI must
produce the same kind of value that the callback accepts as input.

This may be best understood by examining the prop types:

```typescript
type RunFlareProps<A> = {
  flare: Flare<A>;
  handler: (a: A) => void;
  // ...
};
```

## Common Use Case

While the generic implementation of `RunFlare` supports a wide variety of use
cases, it may be helpful to consider perhaps the most common use case of
displaying some element as a function of user input, as shown on the
[Examples](/examples) page. For this use case,
[`ReactNode`](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/14f568cded146f89864a06da1884364bd4e6ced0/types/react/index.d.ts#L237)
(or a more restrictive subtype) may be substituted in place of `A`:

```typescript
type RunFlareProps<ReactNode> = {
  flare: Flare<ReactNode>;
  handler: (a: ReactNode) => void;
};
```

Thus, the UI passed to the `flare` prop must produce a type of value that is
assignable to `ReactNode`. If it does not, then the
[`map`](/api-docs/flare-core#map) function may offer a solution by providing the
means to transform the value that the UI produces.

Similarly, the `handler` prop callback must accept a `ReactNode` as input and
produce a side effect.

In this case, the side effect is that of mutating a `ReactNode` value held in
state. Usually, the
[`useState`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate) hook is all
that is required:

```jsx
const [flareOutput, setFlareOutput] = useState<ReactNode>();

// ...

<RunFlare
  flare={/*...*/}
  handler={setFlareOutput} />
```

Finally, the `flareOutput` node can be rendered wherever it belongs in the
component tree, e.g.

```jsx
<div className="output">
  {flareOutput}
</div>
```

## Example

A complete example of a Flare UI embedded inside of React is available on
GitHub. You can launch it inside of CodeSandbox for a live demo.
