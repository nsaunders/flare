# Embedding in React

The [`RunFlare`](https://flare.js.org/api-docs/flare-core#runflare) component
provides the means to embed a Flare UI in a [React](https://reactjs.org)
application.

## Step 1: Flare UI

The first step is to build the UI that produces some value of interest, i.e. a
[`Flare<A>`](https://flare.js.org/api-docs/flare-core#flare). The `A` type
argument will depend on the exact use case, but often (when the goal is to
render some element in response to user inputs) it will be something like
[`ReactNode`](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/14f568cded146f89864a06da1884364bd4e6ced0/types/react/index.d.ts#L237).

## Step 2: Handler

The next requirement is a handler, which is a callback of type
`(value: A) => void` invoked each time the UI produces a new value. Again, the
type `A` will depend on use case (but it must match the output of the
corresponding Flare). The handler can produce any side effect required, such as
mutating state.

## Step 3: `RunFlare`

Finally, the `RunFlare` component is used to render the UI passed to its `flare`
prop and invokes the callback passed to its `handler` prop on each change.
