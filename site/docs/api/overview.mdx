# API

Flare is shipped in two packages. Both provide the same support for building
[applicative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicative_functor)-style user
interfaces as shown on the [Examples](/examples) page, but they differ in how
these UIs are rendered: [flare](/api-docs/flare) offers a simpler API, while
[flare-core](/api-docs/flare-core) offers greater flexibility.

## flare

This package re-exports a subset of flare-core and is the best choice for use
cases where customization requirements are minimal and limited to what can be
achieved with CSS. The [`runFlare`](/api-docs/flare#runflare) or
[`runFlareWith`](/api-docs/flare#runflarewith) procedures can be used to render
the UI.

## flare-core

The flare-core package provides applicative UI building blocks along with
additional APIs that allow the rendered markup to be customized. The
[`RunFlare`](/api-docs/flare-core#runflare)
[React](https://reactjs.org/) component can be used to render the UI, with its
`components` prop allowing various elements to be overridden using custom React
components.
