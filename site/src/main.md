# Flare

Flare offers a simple and efficient way to build complex user interfaces in
TypeScript by leveraging powerful abstractions from functional programming.
It is primarily based on David Peter's
[purescript-flare](https://github.com/sharkdp/purescript-flare) library.

## Installation

```bash
npm install flare
```

Note that you will likely want to install
[fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts), which exports the `pipe` function used
in the examples below, and possibly
[fp-ts-std](https://github.com/samhh/fp-ts-std), which provides curry functions.
